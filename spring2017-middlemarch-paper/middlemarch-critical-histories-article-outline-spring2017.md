## *Middlemarch* Critical Histories Spring 2017 Article Outline ##

Old: Overview for LLC papers: aiming for 9,000 words
New: aiming for more general journals, (eg ELH, NLH, PMLA)

- 1) Introduction: Research question
	- *Middlemarch* on aphorism, novel selection
- 2) Methodology 
	- creating the corpus
	- the text-matcher algorithm 
- 3) Discussion: parts of the novel 
	- 1st half vs. 2nd half
		- Meta-discussion about visualization choices & binning, describing visualization choices for non-digital humanist readers
	- Which books (of the 8 books) are most /least quoted
	- Which chapters are most/least quoted
		- Chapter 20 
	- Which paragraphs (within Chapter 20) are most/least quoted
		- Annotated edition? Jokey footnote
	- Diachronic
		- The rise and fall of chapter 15, this way of talking about the value of a diachronic analysis 
			- Compare diachronic view with a synchronic heat map  
- 4) Discussion: insights into the field
	- Distinctive keywords (lemmatized)
	- Specialist journals vs. nonspecialist
- 5) Extension to other critical traditions
	- Sociology of literature
		- Thinking about the received practices of citation (Bourdieu)
		- What are the practices of scholarly citation (eg tacit knowledge about what is already quoted; what are "canonical" quotations, proportion of frequently cited to relatively infrequently cited quotations) 
	- Theories of reading

## To Do: ##

- Clearly articulate our research question
- What we need to make sure we have to move forward:
	- A complete set of results by quotations based on number of quotes, not on word count 
	- A complete set of result by number of words
	- A complete set of results, by number of words, normalized by chapter length
	- The heat map with normalized number of words, synchronic
	- The heat map with normalized number of words, diachronic
	- List of the top 25 keywords, synchronic and diachronic
	- Redo specialist/nonspecialist based on number of words, normalized per chapter
		- complete data set of those results 
		- Compare chapter 20
		- What's the most quoted chapter in the specialist journals?
		- Decide on visualization (split bar chart or current visualization) 
- Questions:
	- Are keywords weighted by frequency or not? if not, then, these need to be weighted by frequency

## Cut Sections ##

-  Visualization: the question of how to visualize
	- Have this in the section the issues of how to represent it -- ALSO methodological
	- a way of bringing in non-digital people into the paper? 
	- the bin and unit sizes 
- Later, with Stanford 
	- [4] Discuss how to bring their corpus together with ours
- What's our timeline for the collaborative meeting?
- Topics to discuss with sSanford 
	- Questions for synchronizing
		-  use same text matcher?
		- use same divisions/segmentation?
	- Chapters? even chunks
	- How do we want to handle the eta component in the paper?
